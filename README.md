# SNP_Wrap_Python
Facilitates post-processing of SNP pipeline outputs

The best-developed script in this package is intersectTwo_colTabSNPs.py, which reads five-column or six-column summaries of vcf files. The option, '--outputType T' produces a five-column .tsv as output while the option '--union' computes union of SNPs positions instead of intersection.

For example:

```python intersectTwo_colTabSNPs.py sample-1.six-col.tsv sample-2.six-col.tsv --outputType T```

Where sample-1.six-col.tsv and sample-2.six-col.tsv would have been generated by the commands:

```perl -e 'print("CHROM\tPOS\tREF\tALT\tINFO-DP\tINFO-TYPE\n")' > sample-1.six-col.tsv```

and

```bcftools query -f '%CHROM\t%POS\t%REF\t%ALT\t%INFO/DP\t%INFO/TYPE\n' sample-1.vcf.gz >> sample-1.six-col.tsv```

The script, , is similar to the first, but offers the additional options of displaying input file SNPs positions which are not found in the intersection.

```intersectAndComplement_colTabSNPs.py sample-1.six-col.tsv sample-2.six-col.tsv --outputType D```

Here, 'D' indicates differences between input files, sample-1 and sample2, versus their intersection.
